    <h2>Lolman_000</h2>
      <p>Lolman_000 is a ninth grader at Wayzata. His interests include physics, table tennis, and anime. He also enjoys drawing manga with lots of fanservice. Although he only started watching anime in 7th grade, Lolman_000 has since watched over 200 anime and is a self proclaimed "<strong>Isekai God</strong>". </p>
    <h2>Deshawn Williams</h2>
      <p>Deshawn Williams is also a ninth grader at Wayzata. Although Deshawn had a promising future, any such prospects ended when he met Lolman_000. Lolman_000 converted Deshawn from an innocent child to a teenager with an extremely corrupted mind. How you may ask did he do this? By introducing Deshawn to anime. Since the day that he saw Lolman_000 watch an ecchi anime he has been turned into a monster that writes perverted light novels.</p>
