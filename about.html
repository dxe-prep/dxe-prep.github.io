    <h1>About Us: Your teachers</h1>
    <h2>Ashmit Dutta</h2>
      <p>Ashmit Dutta is a ninth grader at Wayzata. His interests include physics, math, table tennis, and anime. Currently he is participating in Science Bowl, Math Team, and the Table Tennis Club at Wayzata High School. Heis currently taking AP Calc AB this year and will be returning to UMTYMP to take Linear Algebra, and Multivariable Calculus.</p>
    <h2>Deshawn Williams</h2>
      <p>Deshawn Williams is also a ninth grader at Wayzata. Although Deshawn had a promising future, any such prospects ended when he met Lolman_000. Lolman_000 converted Deshawn from an innocent child to a teenager with an extremely corrupted mind. How you may ask did he do this? By introducing Deshawn to anime. Since the day that he saw Lolman_000 watch an ecchi anime he has been turned into a monster that writes perverted light novels.</p>
    <h2>Mr.Yeetus</h2>
      <p> Mr. Yeetus as you might have expected is a ninth grader at Wayazata. Although the most innocent in terms of anime, Mr. Yeetus is arguably the most well versed in the tricks of the trade as he has been watching anime since the 4th grade. Unlike Deshawn Williams and Lolman_000, Mr. Yeetus is is not a perverted beast and goes about his life like a normal high schooler. However, he is still a big weeb and his expertise turns our products into perfection.</p>
